a pointer is variable which stores a memeory address.
an array variable also stores a memory address.

int *ptrint;
double* ptrDou;

we may point to any type.

All pointers have the same size
32-bit = 4bytes
64-bit = 8bytes

32 bits = 2^32 bytes = 4GB
64 bits = 2^64 bytes = 16GB

address of operator &
this returns "the address of a variable."

- ptr points to a
- ptr stores the address of a.
int a = 5;
int* ptr = &a;


- &: The address of operator.
it returns a variable address.
- only perform & on a variable.
- can get usal variable's or a pointer variable's address

- *: The dereference operator.
it returns the pointed variable.
- cannot change a variable's address.
